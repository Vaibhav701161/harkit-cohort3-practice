# **Harkit Cohort 3 Practice**  

This repository serves as a structured and comprehensive learning resource for the concepts covered in **Harkit Singh's Cohort 3**. It includes theoretical interview questions, real-world programming problems, and implementation-based exercises for each topic.  

## **Objective**  

The primary goal of this repository is to systematically document and reinforce concepts learned through the cohort. Each topic is supplemented with:  

- **Interview Questions:** Theory-based questions commonly asked in technical interviews.  
- **Real-World Programming Problems:** Practical coding challenges that simulate real-world use cases.  
- **Implementation Exercises:** Code-based solutions to solidify understanding.  

## **Repository Structure**  

The repository follows a structured format to ensure organized learning and revision:

```

Each topic has a dedicated folder containing interview questions, real-world programming challenges, and a summary of key learnings. This ensures a structured approach to mastering the subject matter.  

## **Usage**  

This repository is intended for structured learning, revision, and interview preparation. Each topic can be studied independently, with theoretical and practical components reinforcing one another.  

## **About This Repository**  

This repository will be actively updated as the cohort progresses. It is designed to serve as a long-term reference for in-depth technical understanding and hands-on problem-solving.
