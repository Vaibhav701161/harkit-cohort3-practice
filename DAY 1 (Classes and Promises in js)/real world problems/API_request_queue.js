4. Implement an API Request Queue Using Promises
ðŸ’¡ Scenario: You are building a dashboard that fetches data from multiple APIs, but to avoid API rate limits, you need to queue the requests.

Implement a function fetchWithQueue(urls), where urls is an array of API endpoints.

Fetch one URL at a time, wait for the previous request to finish before making the next request.

Use Promises to chain the requests properly.
