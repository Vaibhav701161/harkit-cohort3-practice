/*
1. Design a User Management System using Classes
ðŸ’¡ Scenario: You are building a user authentication system for a web application. You need to create a User class with the following functionalities:

Store user information (name, email, password).

A method to check if the password is correct (checkPassword()).

A method to display user details securely (without exposing the password).

ðŸ”§ Implement this using a JavaScript class.
